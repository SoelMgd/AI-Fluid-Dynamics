Using CNNs to solve Navier-Stokes Equations

## Introduction and Context
Efficient simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow is a longstanding problem in applied mathematics, traditionally requiring substantial computational resources. However, in many scenarios, an exact solution is not necessary. Fast, real-time computations with highly realistic simulations are sufficient, such as in movies or video games.

This notebook aims to present recent and promising methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve fast and realistic simulations.
